## Background
This app is called Eat-da-Burger and it was done as homework for the February 2018 UNC Coding Boot Camp.

## How to get started with the app
The application is online at https://frozen-hollows-67583.herokuapp.com/. You will more than likely have to wait a little while after visiting this url before Heroku spins up the virtual machine which hosts the project.

Please install Git Bash, MySQL, and Node.js if you want to use the app locally. 

After all of these are installed, download the Eat-Da-Burger.

In the project's root directory:
  Install the database from the command line by by entering:

      mysql -u root -p < schema.sql
      Enter password: <enter password here>

      mysql -u root -p < seeds.sql
      Enter password: <enter password here>

  Next install the project dependencies by entering:

      npm install

The project is now ready to run!

Start the server by typing in:

    node server.js

Open a browser and navigate to:

  http://localhost:8080/ 

in the address line.


Start adding your burgers!

Click a Devour button to eat one of the burgers!
